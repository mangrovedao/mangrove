/**
 * This script allows you to posts two offers (with one that fails) on market.
 * Its goal is to reproduce on the front side the behavior of a transaction where an offer is eaten and another offer reverts.
 *
 * This script has "TestingSetup" as dependency, which means that this script will be executed after the whole Mangrove ecosystem is deployed and freshly installed.
 *
 * By running this script you'll be able to interact with a fresh local chain containing Mangrove contracts.
